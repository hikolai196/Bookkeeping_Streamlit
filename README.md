# Bookkeeping APP README

This is an interactive Streamlit app designed to provide a user-friendly interface with bookkeeping data from CSV files. Users can easily switch between different datasets by changing the filename as per their preference.

## Introduction
The purpose of this codebase and its accompanying application (Streamlit) lies in simplifying financial record management for individuals or small businesses who wish to maintain a clear overview without delving deep into spreadsheet software complexities. It's particularly beneficial for those new to bookkeeping, offering an intuitive way to track income/expenses and generate basic reports directly from their CSV data files.
